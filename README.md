# BookEmbeddings
This repo currently contains Python code to determine if graphs are Mobius one-page embeddable. If the graph is able to, the program will find one possible one-page Mobius embedding. It also has the ability to create permutations of up 11 elements, which is used to create the different permutations of the vertices. 

### Future Plans
I plan to create additional classes that will be able to find one-page embeddings on torus books and klein bottle books.
